**Correlate your symptoms with your medical reports**

You get your blood report and you have no idea what high triglycerides mean, what low vitamin D means, what high WBC means. You get confused and anxious.

*What does that matter to me?*  
*Why am I always so tired?*  
*Why does my stomach hurt?*

You don't want a chemistry lesson when you feel like crap. You want answers, but instead, you get terrified, confused, and anxious by a wall of chemical jargon.

With BadBlood, you finally can correlate your symptoms with your medical report.
