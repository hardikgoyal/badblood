# 🩸 BadBlood 

> *"‘Cause, baby, now we got bad blood. You know it used to be mad love."* — Taylor Swift

**Stop guessing what your blood test means.**

You get your lab results back. It's a 14-page PDF. It says your "Vitamin D (25-OH)" is low and your "IgE Total" is high. 

*What does that actually mean?*  
*Why are you always so tired?*  
*Why does your stomach hurt?*

You don't want a chemistry lesson. You want to know why you feel like crap. You want answers, but instead, you get terrified, confused, and anxious by a wall of chemical jargon.

With BadBlood, you don't just see your data. You finally understand it.

## 🕷️ What BadBlood Does

### 1. Analyze Your Symptoms (Core Focus)
Tell BadBlood how you feel. *"I'm exhausted every afternoon"* or *"My joints ache."*

BadBlood instantly scans your messy lab report and connects the dots between your raw numbers and your actual physical pain. It highlights exactly which out-of-range markers are causing your symptoms. 

No more Googling "high WBC causes" at 2 AM. You get a direct, actionable briefing that tells you exactly what might be wrong and exactly what questions you need to ask your doctor.

### 2. Instant Visual Health Map
We also transform the antiquated, hard-to-read wall of data into a living, intuitive map of your biological state.

</p>

See instantly if your "Heart" or "Energy" is spiking out of range, without needing a medical degree. Center (0) is optimal health; outer edges (10) indicate high risk.

## 🤖 The Unfair Advantage: Native AI Integration via MCP

Building another standalone health portal or app is a losing battle. Patients do not want yet another login.

BadBlood is built from the ground up as a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**. This is our trojan horse. By functioning as an MCP server, BadBlood injects its intelligence directly into the AI assistants patients *already* use and trust—like **ChatGPT** and **Claude**. 

**Zero friction. Zero new downloads. Maximum accessibility.**

## 📈 The Business Case & Market Opportunity

We are targeting a massive, unaddressed intersection in consumer health and generative AI.

1. **Massive TAM:** The global clinical laboratory services market is massive, yet the *patient experience* layer is entirely neglected.
2. **B2C Distribution Strategy (Freemium):** We utilize the viral, low-friction nature of MCP tools. Basic extraction and visualization are free, driving rapid user adoption via ChatGPT/Claude plugin ecosystems.
3. **B2B Licensing Potential:** Telehealth providers, modern clinics, and forward-thinking EHR systems desperately need to improve patient engagement. BadBlood's translation layer can be white-labeled via our API to vastly improve standard patient portals.

## 🛠️ The Technology (Under the Hood)

BadBlood is built on a scalable, modular architecture powered by the mcp-use framework and LLMs.

1. **Contextual Engine:** Cross-references clinical values with reported symptoms to generate actionable, empathetic insights.
2. **Extraction Engine:** Seamlessly ingests and structures complex, unstructured PDF data.
3. **Dynamic Visualization:** Outputs strict JSON payloads to instantly render intuitive Radar/Spider Charts on the frontend, rejecting complex standalone app development in favor of pure, data-driven visualization injected into chat interfaces.
